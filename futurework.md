### General to-do
  - Use best algorithm on Kaggle test set and upload 
  - Algorithm comparison tool

### Independent Component Analysis
  - More extensive artifact removal 
  - Automate the artifact identification process

### Feature Extraction
  - Time-frequency domain features 
  - Covariance matrix as a feature (results in (nÂ²+n)/2 features for n channels)
  - Other dimensionality reduction methods e.g. sequential feature selection

### Classification 
  - Test larger, more complex models
  - Ensemble of classifiers
  - Postprocessing of model outputs
